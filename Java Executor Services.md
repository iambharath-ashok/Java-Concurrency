# Java Executor Service

### 1. Introduction


	Code Snippet of Creating a Thread in Java: 

		public class MainClass {

			public static void main(String ... args) {
				Thread thread = new Thread(new Task())
				thread.start();
				System.out.println("Thread Name : "+ Thread.currentThread().getName());
			}

			static class Task implements Runnable {
				
				@Override
				public void run() {
					System.out.println("Thread Name : "+ Thread.currentThread().getName());
				}
			}
		}	


#### 1.	Main Thread will continue to run till the end of the execution

#### 2.	When t1.start() is executed then a new thread will be created with name thread-0
	
- 	Once thread has been created its start to work asynchronously 
-	At same time Main thread also continue its execution
-	Once thread task is completed Java will delete that Thread

#### 3. 	In Java, 1 Java Thread = 1 OS Thread

#### 4.	Creating Threads is a Expensive task
	
-	Creating 100 threads to perform 100 task is an very Expensive task
-	Instead we need to create a pool of Threads - this pool of threads is called Thread Pool
-	We will assign 100 task to Thread pool of 10 

	-	Each thread will start with one task at a time
	-	Once task is completed on particular thread then it will pick up another task
	
#### 5.	Executor Service
	
-	Executors has 4 static methods to get the pool of threads
-	Executors will return ExecutorService that is used to execute or submit the task to Blocking queue
-	Instead of creating a thread, now a task is submitted to ExecutorService



		
	### Thread Pool Executor
	
	-	Thread Pool Executor internally uses Blocking Queue
	-	All the task that are submitted to ExecutorService are stored in a Blocking Queue
	-	All Threads within Thread Pool Executor will perform 2 steps
		
		1.	Fetch next Tasks from Queue
		2.	Execute the Tasks

	-	Since all the threads with in Thread Pool Executor pick up tasks at same time - Concurrently
		
		-	Queue should be able to handle Concurrent Operations	
		- 	Thread Pool Executor uses Blocking Queue which is Thread Safe	

		
		
	### Code Snippet of submitting a Tasks to ThreadPool: 
	
		public class MainClass {
		
			public static void main(String [] args) {
				ExecutorService  executorService = Executor.newFixedThreadPool(nThreads:5);
				
				for (int i=0; i < 10; i++) {
					executorService.execute(new Task()); // Submitting 10 Tasks to ThreadPool of 5 Threads
				}
				
			}
			
			
			static class Task implements Runnable {
				
				public void run() {
					System.out.println("Thread Name: "+ Thread.currentThread().getName());
				}
			}
		}




#### 6.	Ideal Size of Thread Pool
	
-	Ideal size of Thread Pool depends on the Task that we going to perform inside the run methods
-	Tasks can be CPU Intensive or IO Intensive Tasks	
	
	### 1.  CPU Intensive Task
	
	-	If Tasks were CPU intensive then Thread Pool Size depends on the number of CPU cores
		
		-	If tasks is CPU intensive like algorithm to create hash function or Cryptography then it consumes more CPU

	-	If CPU is having only 4 cores, then we can run only 4 threads at a time irrespective of number of Threads
		
		-	A CPU with 4 cores and 1000 threads will use the Time Split Scheduling Algorith
				
			-	It will give some time to one of the thread and bump it off
			-	This will result in performance degradations
			-	In this case, Ideal Pool size is to have the same number of cores in the CPU
				
					
					
					
	#### Code Snippet of having Ideal number of Threads depending on number of Cores:
						
			public class MainClass {
				
				public static void main(String ... args) {
					int coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
					ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(coreCount);
					
					for ( int i=0; i < 10; i++ ) {
						executorService.execute(new CPUIntensiveTask());
					}
				}
				
				
				static class CPUIntensiveTask implements Runnable {
				
					public void run() {
						// Code to be Executed as Part of Thread
					}
				
				}
			}
				
		
	
	
	### 2.	IO Intensive Task
		
	-	I/O Intensive Task are like DB call or HTTP call,  N/w calls
	-	For I/O Intensive Tasks, we can have large Thread Pool Size
	-	Ideally for I/O calls Threads will be in a Waiting State 
		
		-	So we can have a other threads to continue the tasks				
			
	
	#### Code Snippet of IO Intensive Task: 
	
			public class MainClass {
						
				public static void main(String ... args) {

					ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(nThreads:50);
					
					for ( int i=0; i < 10; i++ ) {
						executorService.execute(new IOIntersiveTask());
					}
				}
				
				
				static class IOIntersiveTask implements Runnable {
				
					public void run() {
						// Code to be Executed as Part of Thread
					}
				
				}
			}
	
	
	
	
### Summary 
	
-	Thread Pool Size depends on the Task that we are going to perform
-	Ideal Thread Pool Size for CPU Intensive task will depends on the Number of Cores on CPU
	-	How many other Executors or Threads are running on the same CPU
	
-	Ideal Thread Pool Size for I/O Intensive task will be higher like 100
	-	Exact number of threads depends on 
		-  Rate of task submission
		-  Average task wait time
	-	Too many threads will increase Memory Consumption leading JVM crash or OutOfMemoryError

## 2. Types of Thread Pools

###	1. Fixed Thread Pool

### 2. Cached Thread Pool

### 3. Scheduled Thread Pool

### 4. Single Threaded Executor

	
	
###	1. Fixed Thread Pool

-	Has Fixed Number of Threads
-	N number of Tasks can be submitted to Threads
- 	All Tasks will be stored in Queue called Blocking Queue
-	Queue should be Thread Safe ... 
-	Thread Pool will fetch tasks from queue and execute on Thread

###	2. Cached Thread Pool

-	Doesn't have Fixed Number of Threads
-	Doesn't have queue that holds the Number of Tasks
-	Queue used in Cached Thread Pool is Synchronous Queue ... which can hold only one Item or Task at a Time
-	When task is submitted ... Cached Thread Pool will search for if any IDLE Threads

	-	If no IDLE Threads found it will create a new Thread and assign Task to that Thread
	
-	Life Cycle: 	Cached Thread Pool has ability to create 1000 Threads to meet demands
-	Cached Thread Pool also has ability to Kill Threads once no Further Tasks are available
-	If Thread is idle for more 60 Seconds then ... Thread will be killed


###	3. Scheduled Thread Pool

-	Schedule Thread Pool is for Tasks that should after certain amount of delay
-	Life Cycle: More Threads are created if Required
-	Delay Queue is used to store the Tasks

	#### Different types of Scheduling

	### 1. schedule() 
		
	-	Schedule a Task to run after certain delay ... i.e 10 Seconds

	### 2. scheduleAtFixedRate()
		
	-	Perform some Task every 10 Seconds
	-	Tasks will be stored in Delay Queue
	-	Tasks will be stored in Queue according to their Delay Period
	-	10 Seconds tasks will at front and 10 Minutes Task will be next to 10 Second Delay Task
	
	### 3. scheduleAtFixedDelay()
	
	-	Will run after some fixed delay from completion of task 
	-	Fixed deley is 5 Second and Task will run for 15 Seconds ... then Task will Schedule to run after 5 Seconds from completion of Task
	
	#### Code Snippet of ScheduledThreadPool
	
	
		Code Snippet: 
		
			public void main(String ... args) {
			
				ScheduledExecutorService scheduledThreadPool = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(5);
				
				
				// Tasks to run after 10 Seconds Delay
				scheduledThreadPool.schedule(new Task(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
				
				// Tasks to run repeatedly after 10 Seconds with initial delay of 10 Seconds
				scheduledThreadPool.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Task(), initialDelay: 10, period: 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
				
				
				// Task to run repeatedly after 10 Seconds after previous Task Completion
				scheduledThreadPool.scheduleAtFixedDelay(new Task(), initialDelay: 10, delay: 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
			
			
			}
		
###	4. 	Single Threaded Executor

-	Size of the Pool will be only one 
-	Life Cycle: Only one Thread will fetch Task from Blocking Queue and Executes it
-	If Thread got killed due any exception ... then Thread Pool will recreate a new Thread
-	Thread Pool will make sure that at least 1 Thread will be executing tasks at a time
-	There will be only one Thread
-	Since only 1 Thread ... only 1 Task will executed at a time
-	This Thread Pool type will used to make sure that Task1, Task2, Task3 ... be executed in sequentially

	
-------------------------------------------------------------	
	
## 3. Callable and Future
	
-	Callable Interface returns a value from Thread
-	Callable Task should override call method and provide implementation
-	With combination of Callable and Future ... we can submit a Task and perform some operations
-	And call future.get() method to get a value after some time
-	Future is like a container or place holder ... once value is available ... result will be added to Future container ... future.get() method call will returns value from future placeholder
-	future.get() overloaded method provides TimeOut Value ... that maximum amount of time that Thread is Waiting for Task complete the operations
-	future.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
-	Once TimeOut or value in Future is not available with value ... then TimeOutException will be Thrown		
	
-	future.cancel(false) method is used to cancel the Tasks
-	future.isCancelled() returns true or false ... whether task is canceled or not 
-	future.isDone() ---> Return true if task is completed
	
-------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Constructors and LifeCycle Methods


-	Advanced concepts in Executors


	### Pool Size Changes
	
	-	Thread Pool can be created by using factory methods provided by Executor Service
	-	Thread Pool can also created by customizing it ... by calling constructors directly
	-	Thread Pool will take below things as Parameters
	
		-	corePoolSize 
			-	Type: int
			-	Minimum/Base size of the Pool
			
		-	maxPoolSize 
			-	Type: int
			- Maximum Size of the Pool
			
		-	keepAliveTime + Unit 
			-	Type: long
			-	Time to keep an idle Thread Alive(After which it is killed)
		
		-	Work Queue
			-	Type: Blocking Queue
			-	Queue to store tasks from which Threads will fetch them
			
		-	Thread Factory
			-	Type: Thread Factory
			-	Factory to use to create new Threads
			
		-	Handler 
			-	Type: RejectedExecutionHandler
			-	Callback to use when tasks submitted are rejected
	
	### Queue Types
	
	-	LinkedBlockingQueue
		-	FixedThreahPool and SingleThreadExecutor uses LinkedBlockingQueue
		-	LinkedBlockingQueue don't have size constraints
		-	Number of Threads is Limited but Number Tasks can be unlimited
		-	Any number of Tasks can be stored in LinkedBlockingQueue
		
	-	Synchronous Queue
		-	CachedThreadPool uses Synchronous Queue
		-	Threads are unbounded ... no limits on Number of Threads
		-	No need to store Task on Queue
		
	- 	Delayed Work Queue
		-	ScheduledThreadPool uses Delayed Work Queue
		-	Special Type of Queue 
		-	Delayed Queue stores the Tasks based on their execution time
		-	Delayed Queue return Tasks based on Scheduled Time
		
	-	Array Blocking Queue
		-	ArrayBlocking Queue is limited size
		-	If Queue gets full ... new Threads will created
	
	
	###	Life Cycle Methods
	
	-	threadPool.shutdown()
		-	Initiate Termination
		-	Will Throw RejectedExecutionHandler if Tries to add new Task to ThreadPool
		
	-	threadPool.isShutdown()
		-  Returns true or false based whether threadPool is initiated termination or not	
		
	-	threadPool.isTerminated()
		-	Returns true if all Task are completed including Queued ones
		
	-	threadPool.awaitTermination(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
		-	Block until all Tasks are completed
